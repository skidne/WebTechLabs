# Laboratory No.4

# Goals

- Understand how authentification and authorization works;
- Get more familiar with MVC pattern;

# Tasks

### Main requirements:

- Basic authentification system (basically, the autentificated user can do anything);

### Bonus points:
- 2 or more roles are defined and they have different actions defined and each role has well defined permissions; `(2 pt)`


# Implementation

- To run the application, clone this project, open Visual Studio, and Build and Run (F5).

### Main Requirements:

- The basic authentication system has been implemented - the User can draw and post drawings to the gallery, also they can delete their own drawings if they want to. Guests can only see the gallery, and sign up or sign in, nothing else;

- Also, the usage of role-based authorization in ASP.NET using data annotations prevents guests from entering certain pages if they're not authenticated.


# Conclusions
- The authentication system was quite easy to implement, after the struggle I had with the database.
