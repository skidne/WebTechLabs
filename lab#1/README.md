# Laboratory Work No.1-2

### Goal: Familiarization with Bootstrap and ASP.NET integration

#### Website theme:

The chosen theme for this website is an online *battle* or *war* between artists.

Basically, it's (going to be) a canvas, where 2 users can compete against each other using their art skills.

Details like who wins/loses will be based on ratings from other users, who can watch the available battles and rate them.

#### Implemented features:

1. By default, the usage of Bootstrap makes the pages responsive
1. The overall look (pallette) of the website (using the Darkly theme for Bootstrap)
1. The navbar and footer (with clickable buttons, that redirect to other pages, most of them WIPs)
1. The usage of ASP.NET's layouts (only the main content is changed across pages)
1. ASP.NET's bundling and minification (which improves the first page request load time)

----

#### How to run the website

- The recommended approach is to open the project in Visual Studio, and run it. (duh)
- A harder approach involves manually setting a server, doing some magic and somehow running it. ( :| )
