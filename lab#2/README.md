# Laboratory No.2

### Goal: MVC Framework - ASP.NET


#### Implemented features:

1. Integration with ASP.NET
1. The application has more than one page
1. The usage of ASP.NET's layouts (only the main content is changed across pages)
1. ASP.NET's bundling and minification (which improves the first page request load time)

#### How to run the website

- The recommended approach is to open the project in Visual Studio, and run it. (duh)
- A harder approach involves manually setting a server, doing some magic and somehow running it. ( :| )
